# Illinois Framework Distribution

The goal of the Illinois Framework is to let people at UIUC rapildy create and deploy an accessible Illinois branded Drupal website that includes a common set of features. The ability to setup and maintain a Drupal website is required to use this framework. 

# Installing

The preferred way to install the Illinois Framework is via Composer. Please refer to our [Composer-based project template](https://github.com/web-illinois/illinois_framework_project) for instructions. 

# What's included

The Illinois Framework pulls together contributed modules, a custom theme, and custom configuration to build a out-of-the-box funtional Drupal website.

## Theme (under development)

The [Illinois Framework Theme](https://github.com/web-illinois/illinois_framework_theme) is designed to be accessible and meet the current UIUC branding standards. If customization is needed, you can [create a sub-theme](https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/creating-sub-themes) that customizes only the parts needed.

## Core module

The [Illinois Framework Core](https://github.com/web-illinois/illinois_framework_core) module defines what contrib modules are included, along with the default content types that come with the framework. 

### Core Content Types
The default set of content types included are:

- Content Page
- News
- Blog
- Spotlight
- Highlighted courses
- Giving Fund/Fund Listing Page
- Award/Award Winner

The framework also makes use of [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) for page layout and customization.
